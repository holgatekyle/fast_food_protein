##Healthier Choices Outside the Drive Through

The goal of Fast Food Protein is to help you make smarter choices at your favorite fast food restaurants, but today we're going to take a look at some alternatives to fast food that should help your health even further. If you're like me and find yourself at fast food joints mainly due to time-constraints, then protein bars can be the perfect substitute that meet a slew of criteria - on-the-go, filling, protein-rich, etc.

Some protein bars taste terrible, though. Nothing's more disappointing than biting into your "cookie dough" flavored protein bar and finding it taste more like "glue and chemicals". Here's a list of some of my favorites that won't disappoint-

##The Top Protein Bars

<ul>
<li><h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X2LH9Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004X2LH9Y&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-amazon-top3-20&linkId=JOEPHDKGM5BZHJKZ" target="_blank">Rise Bar Protein Almond Honey</a></h3></li>

This is the latest protein bar I've tried, and the taste and texture is phenominal. With only 3 ingredients (not a typo), I don't know if I should be shocked or have expected it to taste so good, but in this case clearly less or better. Rise Bars also come in unique flavors such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DKIYUU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005DKIYUU&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=DMY42K4LCDEUAP4N" target="_blank">Crunchy Carob Chip</a> and (vegan) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFY0YSW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HFY0YSW&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=JP4CUDBGKEFM4SQC" target="_blank">Lemon Cashew</a>. These aren't flavors I'd normally pick off the shelf after reading their name, but these are both delicious as well. You certainly won't be disappoint by the taste from a Rise Bar.

<li><h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I0DI0Z6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00I0DI0Z6&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=XDPGEBTQXUPSF3JF" target="_blank">Quest Nutrition Protein Bar</a></h3></li>

Quest Bars are a great option for those monitoring their net-carbs or looking for a maximal protein/calorie ratio. You're going to sacrafice something on taste and texture here, though. I thought these tasted a bit gluey the first time I tried them, but they grew on me overtime. I'd recommend the Cinnamon Roll flavor for a sublte cinnamon taste, or the Chocolate Brownie if you're into chocolate.

<li><h3>Aldi Fit & Active Protein Bars</h3></li>

I'm not sure you can get these online, but if you have an Aldi grocery store around you, they carry a store-brand of protein bars in flavors like chocolate chip and cookie dough that are pretty good tasting, and much cheaper than any other protein bars you'll find. These are a staple of my diet.

</ul>

That sums up my favorite protein bars of the moment. Have any suggestions for something new to try? Have comments or feedback? Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/FastFoodProtein) or email kyle (at) fastfoodprotein.com.
