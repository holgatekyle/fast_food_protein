##The Problem
Maybe fast food is a regular part of your week due to time constraints. Maybe you're brave enough to admit you just like the way fast food tastes, but you still want to keep your nutrition in check. Maybe you're an Eagle Scout and you just need to be prepared. Whatever your situation, odds are you're going to find yourself eating fast food sometime soon and you're going to want to get *maximum your nutritional value* and avoid the many tasty pitfalls fast food chains can offer. For many of us, this means keeping the **calories low and the protein high**.

Let's look at how you can make better choices the next time you're on a fast food run and get a meal that doesn't ruin the rest of your day.

##Tasty Pitfalls
Here's a list of items that should be avoided if you want to keep your meal healthy-

* **Fries**. 

	French fries are delicious, but a large will typically run you well over 500 calories (some even as high as 1300) with the vast majority of those calories coming from straight carbs [Check out the data](http://www.fastfoodprotein.com/search?company_list%5Blist%5D%5B%5D=&food_name=fries&protein=&max_cals=&max_carbs=&max_fat=&search=Compare) and see for yourself. If you can't fight the craving, Burger King Satisfries and Wendy's appear to be the least egregious of the bunch.
	
* **Shakes**

	Just don't do it. A large shake is going to run you *at least 750 calories*, with most being **900+ calories** and well over 120g carbs! [Don't say I didn't warn you...](http://www.fastfoodprotein.com/search?company_list%5Blist%5D%5B%5D=&food_name=shake&protein=&max_cals=&max_carbs=&max_fat=&search=Compare)
	
* **Beef**

	Generally speaking, beef menu items tend to be higher in fat than chicken and lower in protein than seafood making them the least attractive protein source. They also almost always come on a bun and very rarely served alone or on a salad, which makes beef something to typically avoid. If you're ordering your beef without the bun, then it's really not so bad.
	
##Healthy Choices
