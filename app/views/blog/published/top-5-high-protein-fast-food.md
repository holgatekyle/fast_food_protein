If you have a fever, and the only prescription is more protein, you're not going to want to miss this list.

##Setting the Table

**Protein** is the most highly sought-after nutrient in society today. As low-fat, high-carb and low-carb, high-fat diet crazes come and go, the one thing everyone can seem to agree on is the essentiality of protein. 

For those looking to get fit and gain muscle, a high-protein diet is the keystone to any training plan. If you're wondering how much is enough, <a href="http://examine.com/faq/how-much-protein-do-i-need-every-day.html" target="_blank">extensive research</a> has been done into protein consumption with optimal ranges found to be *at least* .36g/lb bodyweight for sedentary lifestyles, and up to 1g/lb bodyweight for athletes.

##Time to Feast

The list below assumes you care about getting a massive amount of protein from your meal and aren't worried about the calories (if you ARE keeping your calories low, you can check out our [healthy fast food choices](http://www.fastfoodprotein.com/blog/best-healthy-fast-food) article).

Enough talk, you're hungry. Let's get to the goods. We'll work down [our top protein list](http://fastfoodprotein.com/search?company_list%5Blist%5D%5B%5D=&food_name=&protein=&max_cals=&max_carbs=&max_fat=&search=Compare&sort=4), seeing the best of what the big chains have to offer.

* **Carl's Jr./Zaxby's 20-piece Chicken Fingers - 164g/182g**

	First up, 20-piece chicken tenders from two different chains that are equally impressive. At 1760 and 1740 calories, if you can finish either in one sitting you deserve a parade.
	
	Interestingly, McDonalds 40-piece Chicken McNugget is also near the top of our list, but pales in comparison to even a 10-piece chicken tender meal from the above chains in terms of nutritional content. Kinda begs the question, what the hell is a McNugget?
	
	Zaxby's 10-piece Chicken Finger- *Calories 870, Protein 91g*
	
	Carl's Jr. 10-piece Chicken Tender- *Calories 880, Protein 82g*
	
	McDonalds 40-piece Chicken McNugget- *Calories 1880, Protein 87g*

* **Jimmy Johns J.J. Gargantuan - 72.4g, 1104 cals**

	5 different meats + cheese = plenty of protein. The J.J. Gargantuan is the top sandwich on our list and an excellent "lighter" choice compared to fried and grilled options.
	
* **Wendy's 3/4 Lb. Triple w/ Cheese - 69g, 1090 cals**

	The biggest item on Wendy's menu in terms of calories and protein, even beating (beefing?) out the Baconator, this triple-burger sandwich is the top beef item on our list.

* **Super Sonic Bacon Double Cheeseburger - 67g, 1240 cals**

	Half a pound of beef, two slices of cheese, and crispy bacon puts this Sonic burger fourth on our list of high protein fast food items. 
	
* **In n Out Burger 4x4 Cheeseburger - 67g, 1050 cals**

	Rounding out our top 5, the favorites of the West coast - In n Out Burger. With 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese, there's a lot to love about this burger.
