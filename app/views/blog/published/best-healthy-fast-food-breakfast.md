For those of us who aren't early-risers, making breakfast everyday can be a challenge. Some days it might just be easier to grab something on the way to work, but if you head to the drive-thru without a game plan, you could end up with a sugar crash that wrecks your entire day. I'll help you out with a list of what *fast food breakfast you need to avoid*, as well as what *healthy items* will get your day started on the right foot.

##Unhealthy Options to Avoid

First off, let's start with the worst of the worst. These are categories you need to avoid, regardless of the restaurant chain.

- **Breakfast "Platters" and Pancakes**

	If something's described as a "platter", stay away! **These are typically heavy with pancakes or french toast and loaded with sugar**. Here's a few examples of the nutritional content of pancake breakfasts- BK Ultimate Breafast Platter - *1420 calories, 139g carbs, 41g sugar*; McDonalds Big Breakfast w/ Hotcakes (Large Biscuit) - *1150 calories, 116g carbs, 17g sugar (no syrup)*; Whataburger Pancakes - *700 calories, 143g carbs, 42g sugar*.
	
- **Sausage**

	**Sausage is going to be the highest-calorie and highest-fat meat option** in breakfast sandwiches, so if you're counting calories you'd be wise to avoid it. Let's compare sandwiches from Chick-fil-A: Bacon, Egg & Cheese Biscuit - *450 calories, 23g fat* vs Sausage, Egg & Cheese - *670 calories, 45g fat*. And one example from Dunkin Donuts: Ham, Egg & Cheese on Plain Bagel - *440 calories, 8g fat* vs Sausage, Egg & Cheese on Plain Bagel - *620 calories, 26g fat*.

- **Sugary Treats**

	You probably know breakfast offerings like cinnamon buns should be avoided, but *did you know just how bad their nutrition is?* McDonalds Cinnamon Melts have *460 calories and 32g of sugar*. Taco Bell's Cinnabon Delights (12 pack) have *930 calories and 59g of sugar*. Clearly, these options wouldn't get your day started on the right foot.

##Healthy Breakfast Alternatives

Now let's find some **healthier alternatives** for breakfast. Eggs and egg whites are going to be a staple of our search, as they offer *high-quality protein and low calories*.

- **Subway 3" Turkey, Egg White & Cheese** - *180 calories, 22g carbs, 5g fat, 12g protein*

	Also available in a 6" if you need more fuel to start your day, this sandwich only comes with 1g of sugar at either size.
	
- **Taco Bell A.M. Grilled Taco Bacon** - *230 calories, 15g carbs, 14g fat, 12g protein*

	Any of the A.M. Grilled Taco varieties from Taco Bell are decent choices, I think the nutrition of the bacon variety is actually the best. Only 1g of sugar here as well.
	
- **McDonalds Egg White Delight** - *250 calories, 30g carbs, 8g fat, 18g protein*

	Getting higher in calories and carbs now, but this breakfast option only has 3g of sugar and 4g of fiber. The Egg White Delight is an excellent option for those looking for a **high-protein breakfast**.
	
- **Burger King Breakfast Muffin Sandwich w/ Egg & Cheese** - *260 calories, 27g carbs, 11g fat, 13g protein*

	This is the best breakfast option I found from Burger King. I'd prefer the nutritional content of the Egg White Delight over this sandwich, but it's still a solid choice for those that prefer Burger King.
