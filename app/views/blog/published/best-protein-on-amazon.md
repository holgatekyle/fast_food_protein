##Findings (Protein) Gems on Amazon

Navigating thousands of Amazon's choices for a protein source that fits your needs can be a real hassle. I went ahead and assembled a list of the best options I could find, from *protein powders* to *protein bars*, and even *meats and jerkies*. This is the best Amazon has to offer!

##The Top 9

<small>(Because 10 would be too many)</small>

<ol>
<h3><li value="9"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DUD7I2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002DUD7I2&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=EB64GAJCRL673NYG" target="_blank">CytoSport Muscle Milk Ready-to-Drink Shakes</a></li></h3>

First on the list, these Muscle Milk Protein Shakes are my <strong>favorite tasting to-go option</strong> available on Amazon. They come in last on my list because it's a pricey source of protein and wasteful to use that much plastic for just one protein shake, but it would be worthwhile to buy some if you find yourself at the gas station paying ~4$ a pop often enough.

<h3><li value="8"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025ULK66/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0025ULK66&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=SLCQ2H6CD62C6VKD" target="_blank">Bumble Bee Foods Wild Pink Salmon</a></li></h3>

Keeping with the theme of "on-the-go" snacks, this Bumble Bee Salmon is the best item on the list in terms of <strong>raw, nutritional value</strong>. With 14 grams of protein and only 60 calories, you'll find a lot of different ways to enjoy this fish. Salads, sandwiches, or however else you want to eat it, salmon is a great source of protein with very little mercury content compared to tuna and an excellent source of Omega-3 fatty acids. The nutrition is top-notch.

<h3><li value="7"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G8Y948/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001G8Y948&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=F4JLO5TCU2GW6NVJ" target="_blank">Body Fortress Whey Protein Powder</a></li></h3>

You might know this brand as "the stuff you buy at Walmart when you ran out of your favorite protein powder", and that sums up my thoughts on it too. Not the best tasting or best blending protein powder by any stretch, but if you're budget is tight, it's the <strong>cheapest protein powder</strong> for your money. For that reason, and because judging by the nutritional label it's as good as anything else, it made the list.

<h3><li value="6"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OG1NUO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002OG1NUO&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=EPIQZAGRDCW5PEIM" target="_blank">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Original Flavor</a></li></h3>

The REAL nature's candy, of course it's beef jerky. Available in a slew of different flavors and spices (I'll stick to Original), the <strong>nutrition content is phenomenal</strong>. You really can't beat the taste or flavor of fresh jerky either, the only downfall is how much sodium it contains (75% of the recommended daily value in a bag, yikes!). If that doesn't bother you, be sure to pick some up from Amazon and save a premium versus what the gas station will charge you.

<h3><li value="5"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FRSSFC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FRSSFC&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=XM34DGWM4M4IIHZG" target="_blank">Power Crunch High Protein Energy Bars</a></li></h3>

At number 5, we're venturing into protein bars. This is really more of a <strong>high-protein, small meal replacement bar</strong> as it has balanced nutrient content - 12g of fat, 10g of carbs, and 14g of protein. These bars have a wafer-like makeup and may not be for everyone. I find them to be an excellent aid to bulking season.

<h3><li value="4"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G2UUOS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000G2UUOS&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=D2QOTLJBPDVNS4NX" target="_blank">Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame</a></li></h3>

Edamame is a snack-food that's been growing in popularity, now making appearances on some national restaurant chain menus. <strong>If you eat peanuts, you should seriously consider switching to edamame</strong>. Peanuts are very high in fat, and have a mediocre protein/calorie ratio as a result, whereas edamame is the opposite - 4g of fat, 10g of carbs, 14g of protein. The nutritional kicker here is that edamame also has 8g of fiber! This is a food you <em>need</em> to work into your diet. Edamame may be hard to find in your grocery store, so you might need to rely on Amazon here.

<h3><li value="3"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015QSW4O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0015QSW4O&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-amazon-top3-20&linkId=JGYVBFJMIMJLXPEY" target="_blank">CytoSport Muscle Milk Lean Protein Powder</a></li></h3>

Into the top 3! CytoSport's Muscle Milk makes another appearance, this time in protein powder form. Muscle Milk is hands down <strong>the best tasting powder</strong> I've come across. You'll look forward to your post-workout shake everyday with this stuff. While the nutrition isn't the greatest in terms of raw protein, if you don't mind a few extra calories you'll really enjoy it. The only other drawback is it's a bit pricier than most other powders out there, so you need to consider if taste is worth it.

<h3><li value="2"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I0DI0Z6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00I0DI0Z6&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=72IO4DRS2DR6Q6CW" target="_blank">Quest Nutrition Protein Bars</a></li></h3>

The two-spot on our list goes to Quest Nutrition's Protein Bars. Easily the best and most varied flavors of protein bars I've seen, you're sure to find something you like (I'd recommend Cookies 'n Cream or Cinnamon Roll). <strong>What's really amazing about these is the nutritional content</strong> - most flavors have 20g of protein and 17g of fiber, while being under 200 calories a bar! Worthy of the #2 spot, indeed.

<h3><li value="1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QSNYGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000QSNYGI&linkCode=as2&tag=ffp-blog-20&linkId=RMOBNO5YS5MBFHRB" target="_blank">Optimum Nutrition Whey Gold Standard</a></li></h3>

Finally, King of the Protein List - Optimum Nutrition Whey. <strong>This protein truly is the "Gold Standard"</strong> that all other powders are measured against. This protein powder became so popular (check the Amazon ratings and reviews!) for a few reasons. First, they have a ton of great-tasting choices. Second, the nutritional content delivers. Minimal carbs and fats and typically 24g of protein in 120 calories. Finally, it's priced competitively with the market. They haven't abused their position of market leader by jacking up prices; it's still one of the best values you'll find and consistently of high quality taste.
